Notes on old/deleted branches and what was learned

pregroup2 - pre-grouped and pre-sorted supermers to help highly skewed buckets. Was slow.

aggregator - experimental UDAF aggregator for ReducibleBucket. This was done again, but probably better, in the "skew" branch

reducer2_skew - combination of reducer2 and skew, was not substantially faster than skew by itself

multimotif - combination of multiple short minimizers instead of a single long minimizer. Didn't have much value for my purposes at the time.

bloom - bloom filters for edge detection in de bruijn graph compaction (now an abandoned project)
